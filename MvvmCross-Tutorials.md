## Working With Collections

https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross-Tutorials/tree/master/Working%20With%20Collections

This project demonstrates various techniques for working with lists and other enumerables.

This includes:

- dynamic lists - using `INotifyCollectionChanged`
- large lists - requiring memory virtualisation
- polymorphic lists - where multiple types are contained in the same list
- dictionaries - where items are accessed by `string` index.
